		"question": "Where can I find the app in the app store?",
		"answer": "Hive is a web based app, meaning it is actually just a website optimized for mobile users. This means that the app is not available in any app store because there is no need to download it. The app can however be added to your home screen and it will appear to function like any other local app."
	},
	{
		"question": "How does the app work?",
		"answer": "The app logs into your university account with the details you provided. Once logged in we simply tell the app where to go look for the data we want to display to you. The app then browses the university website and collects the importand data. This can sometimes take a while since the app needs to collect data from multiple pages."
	},
	{
		"question": "How do I add the app to my home screen?",
